## Description
Org Generator will generate an HTML file (by default, team.html) from input you enter.  Input will start with a manager.  From there, you will have the option to enter either Interns or Engineers.  This will cycle through until you have completed entering all Interns and Engineers.  Once completed, your output file will be written.
